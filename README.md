# Object Oriented Programming.

### Goal : Using a simplified version of Fer-de-lance and extending the language by adding support for Object Oriented Programming.

### Features: 
   
   The following are some of the features that are going to be added to the language.
 
    1. Classes definitions and constructors
    2. self
    3. Methods
    4. Fields
    5. Dynamic dispatch
    6. Inheritance - single and multilevel
    7. Overriding
    8. instanceof  
    
## Compiler Pipeline: 

Introducing objects and classes in our language is going to affect all phases of compilation. 
The following are the phases affected  by this new feature and changes in them.

#### Grammer: 
      <dec> : 
       | <classdec>
      <classdec> : 
       | class IDENTIFIER <classfields>
       | class IDENTIFIER extends IDENTIFIER <classfields>
      <classfields> :
       | <classfield>
       | <classfield> <classfields>
      <classfield> : 
       | <field>
       | <method>
      <method> :
       | method IDENTIFIER(<ids>) : <exp>
       | method IDENTIFIER(<ids>) -> <typ> : <exp>
      <field> :
       | field IDENTIFIER
       | field <bind>
      <exprs> : 
       | ...
       | new IDENTIFIER()
       | IDENTIFIER . IDENTIFIER
      
#### Syntax: The following are the new syntax forms added to the language with respect to object oriented programming

#### Well formedness:
             1. Scoping rules for classes defined in global name space
             2. new is reserved keyword
             3. self is reserved keyword.
            
            
#### Type system : Not going to be implemented for the purpose of the project.

#### Tagging : 
#### Anfing :
#### Compilation of Objects

#### 1. class
We store class information in class descriptors, which stores class methods. If a class is inheritated from a base class, the class descriptor should have a pointer to the class descriptor of its base class. For a class

```
class Base
  fields x, y
  def bar(self):
      ...
  def baz(self):
      ...
end
```
A class descriptor should be created on the heap:
```
| base | N | bar | baz |
```
where base is a pointer to its base class, N is the number of class methods. base should be null if the class has no base class.

To handle single inheritance, the class descriptor of the inheritated class should have a pointer to the base class. For the class Der,

```
class Der extends Base
  fields z
  def bar(self):
      ...
  def der(self):
      ...
end
```

Its class descriptor should be like
```
| Base | N | bar | baz | der |
```
where bar should point to the method defined in Der instead of Base.

When a method is being called, like
```
b.bar()
```
First the lookup the class descriptor, which is stored in instance b. With the class descriptor, lookup the method at an offset from the start of the class descriptor. The offset is calculated at compile time. The method is a lambda expression, which can be applied.

#### 2. Instance variables
Class variables are compiled similar to tuples. For a class
```
class Base
  fields x, y
end
```
An instance is stored on the heap like,
```
| descriptor | N | x | y |
```
To handle single inheritance, the fields of the base class is are put in the begining of the extended class, followed by the fiels of the base class. For example,
```
class Der extends Base
  fields z
end
```
is stored on the heap like,
```
| descriptor | N  | x | y | z |
```
#### 3. Support for self
Each class method should come with an argument self so the method can refer to class variables and other methods. self is a pointer to the class instance. To implement self, we'll allocate the heap space with dummy values first when instantiating an object, then fill in the real value including self. When an instance method is being called, self would be passed as the first argument.

#### 4. Support for instanceof
We can use the address of the class descriptor to test class membership,
## Timeline: 
We are diving our project deliverables into two parts. 
### Phase 1: 
In phase 1, we are going to implement records first and then extend it to classes. The end of first phase will include testing the compilation part with different AST representations.
### Phase 2: 
In the phase 2, we are going to focus on getting from the syntax to the AST representation. And test end to end user programs.

In the final write up we are going to mention changes in all phases that includes wellformedness, tagging and static typing. These additional compiler phases focusing on robustness will be added in the actual implementation depending on where we are in the timeline. However our report is going to be detailed wrt to what needs to change.
